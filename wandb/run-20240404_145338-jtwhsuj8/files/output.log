/Users/remi/Documents/PhD/NLP/SpikingExp/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:441: The 'train_dataloader' does not have many workers which may be a bottleneck. Consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument` to `num_workers=7` in the `DataLoader` to improve performance.

Set a lower value for log_every_n_steps if you want to see logs for the training epoch.
